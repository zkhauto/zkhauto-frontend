This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Running the App with Docker Compose (Development)

This project includes a Docker Compose configuration optimized for development using the latest stable Node.js (Node 18). With this setup, hot reloading is enabledâ€”any changes you make locally will be immediately reflected inside the container.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and the new integrated **docker compose** plugin installed on your system.
- Your project directory is the root of this repository.

### Build and Run the Docker Container

Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- The `--build` flag ensures the image is rebuilt if there are any changes to the Dockerfile.
- Docker Compose will build the image, start the container, and mount your local project directory to `/app` in the container, enabling hot reload.

### Access the Application

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Your Next.js app should be running in development mode with hot reloading enabled.

### Stopping the Container

To stop the container, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

This updated configuration uses the latest integrated **docker compose** command, making it easy to manage your development environment without needing the older `docker-compose` command. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional details!
